I started in 2020 with an FHA loan, a W-2, and a blunt strategy: buy under-managed assets and force performance. After the first deal, I used two friends’ FHA loans to pick up ten Connecticut houses and convert them into ~120 rentable rooms. It was messy, labor-heavy, and the best training in operations, tenant management, and expense control I could have asked for.

In 2024 I refinanced, pulled $300k, and moved to Tampa to scale where the upside pays. My first Florida multifamily, a 10-unit at 3408 E Dr. MLK Blvd, outperformed my entire CT portfolio. That locked my focus: 10–20-unit value-add multifamily across the Tampa region.

Today I manage about $4.8M in assets, self-managing renovations with tight crews and no GC markups. The system is simple and repeatable: 85% LTC bridge, heavy rehab fast, refinance in 4–6 months at ≤70% LTV, then recycle capital. Underwriting is disciplined: neighborhood-specific rents, a 40% OpEx baseline, DSCR ≥ 1.20× at refi, and exit caps stressed 50–100 bps. To keep liquidity turning, I run select 1–4-unit flips at 100% LTC that net $60–80k in roughly four months.

What’s next

I’m scaling a Tampa-first, operations-led platform focused on C/C+ assets with clear management and OpEx wins. Near-term goal: $7.1M AUM by year-end 2025. Medium term: $50M by 2030 through steady, repeatable 10–20-unit acquisitions and fast turns. Long term: $1B by 2050, built on disciplined cash recycling and 1031s. Infrastructure scales with the portfolio: in-house construction capability, property management bench, and a lean back office supported by automation and a live portfolio dashboard for transparency.

For prospective LPs
	•	Strategy: Buy right, fix fast, refinance aggressively. Target assets where operations, not speculation, create value.
	•	Edge: Hyper-local execution, speed, and cost control. We do the work ourselves with vetted crews and tight scopes.
	•	Alignment: I co-invest meaningful capital in every deal and underwrite to the same downside you care about. Personal guarantees are on the table when needed.
	•	Risk controls: 85% LTC max at acquisition, 70% LTV refi, 40% OpEx baseline, DSCR ≥ 1.20× post-refi, interest-rate and exit-cap stress tests, 120–150-day turn targets.
	•	Transparency: Standardized reporting and a real-time dashboard that tracks occupancy, rent collection, rehab budget, DSCR, and cash position.

I’m opening a limited allocation for LP co-investments in select Tampa deals where the plan is clear and timelines are tight. The objective is simple: recycle capital twice per year, protect the downside through disciplined underwriting and execution, and let the compounding do the heavy lifting.
